solver improvements
=================
follow proper naming schemes for functions, variables, classes, file etc
Maybe even reorganize and rename functions

write seperate function for fft and ifft
organise flow of calculations, remove redundancies
include functions in SV itself to convert between physical and fourier space.
Shift the a_rad constraints to callbacks.
